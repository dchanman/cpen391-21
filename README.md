Minecraft GO is a real-world geocaching game that rewards players with Minecraft treasures!

Players are given a geographic location to travel to. When they finally arrive, they'll have to dig up their treasure in good old pixellated Minecraft fashion.

Along the way, players might randomly encounter Creeps. They'll have to fight them off on the touchscreen or run fast enough to escape.

How quickly a player reaches a destination affects the quality of the treasure they find.

## Implementation
This project will be implemented on an **Altera DE2 FPGA board** for the **Nios II Processor**.
